    "#### Demodulating the subcarriers\n",

    "There are two other signals in the spectrum, centered at 67 kHz, and 92 kHz. These are subsidiary communications authorization (SCA) services. The FCC specifically doesn't regulate the FM band from 57 kHz up to 100 kHz, only requiring that whatever you transmit there doesn't interfere with the principle FM signal. For a long time this extra spectrum was used for Muzak (a generic name for elevator music), and other targeted FM signals. This has become less common with the advent of the internet, but there are still stations that use these channels. KPFA transmits a Hatian-French subchannel at 67 kHz, and a Punjabi subchannel at 92 kHz.\n",

    "First, demodulate the subcarrier to baseband. We will then low-pass to separate it from the other signals. Then, we will then downsample it to 48KHz, and then frequency demodulate again using the technique described above.\n",
