But how well does compressed sensing work with other sparsity level and undersampling factor? For bandlimited signals, we have the Nyquist rate guiding our sampling strategy. For compressed sensing we will instead look at the __phase transition diagram__.\n",

    "The phase transition diagram is a 2D color plot that can characterize signal recovery performance. On its horizontal axis we have the undersampling factor $\\delta = $( Number of measurements $n$ / Signal length $N$), and its vertical axis, we have the sparsity level $\\rho = $( Number of nonzeros $k$/ Number of measurements $n$). At each point on the 2D plot, we assign the probability of exactly recovering the signal as its value (with a probability of 1 being what we want), so the resulting plot is a color plot.\n",

    "In general, there will be a transition between a success region on the bottom right to a failure region on the top left in the phase transition diagram. This is because given the same number of measurements, more nonzeros in your signal will also make the recovery harder. Similarly, given the same sparsity level, less measurements will make the recovery harder.\n",
